    <p>And unto the Angel of the church of Laodiceans write;These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness,
        the beginning of the creation of God;<br/> 
        I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot.
         So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, 
         I will spue thee out of my mouth.beacause thou sayest, I am rich and increased in goods, and have need of nothing;
        and knowest that thou art wreched, and miserable,and poor,and blind,and naked:</p>
<h1>THE COUNCIL OF THE TRUE AND FAITHFUL WITNESS</h1>
<p>"I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed,
     and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.As many as I love , I rebuke and chasten;Be zealous, and repent.Behold I stand at the door and knock:
    If any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me."<br/>
    
    <em>Revelation 3:14-20</em></p>

<h1>STEPS TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF TRUTH</h1>
<p>“For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.”   
<em>1Timothy 2:4</em>
According to this verse, God wants us not only to be saved, but also ensure the truthfulness of the foundation upon which our faith is built, in order to offer Him acceptable service.</p>
